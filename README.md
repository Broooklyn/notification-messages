# Annoyance Mute

There's always that one guy who brings a Bandos pet to Chambers of Xeric.. _thump_ _thump_ _thump_

..or the one guy at the GE who is always throwing snowballs.

To remedy that, this plugin mutes some annoying sounds without needing to disable area sounds altogether.

It is recommended to enable `Mute other players' area sounds` in the `Music` plugin.
