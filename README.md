# Notification Messages
A simple plugin that lets you customize the notification messages for certain triggers.

Especially useful for those who have `Enable game message notitication` enabled in `RuneLite` settings but would prefer a little more control over the printed notification text than they would get using `Chat Notifications`.
This plugin can also be useful for those who do not wish to be notified when a screenshot is taken but still wish to be notified when they receive a pet.
